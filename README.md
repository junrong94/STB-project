I have decide on using Katalon framework for this STB assignment as it is provides an all-in-one environment for test creation, execution, and management and also web testing capabilities for browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
With Katalon, users can execute tests on different environments, including mobile, web, and desktop apps. This makes it ideal to test applications across various platforms.
Its user-friendly interface, integrations with CI/CD pipelines, flexibility features able to meet various testing requirements and analyze trends, making it easier to pinpoint issues and improve test processes.
